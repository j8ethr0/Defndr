**Defndr is back on the iOS App Store!**

We're thrilled to announce Defndr's return to the App Store! We appreciate your patience during our recent hiatus in repository updates. This pause was a necessary measure to protect Defndr's **intellectual property** and ensure the **unique value** of our core technology.

While we're committed to transparency about how Defndr works, the highly refined machine learning model and vocabulary represent significant development effort. To maintain the integrity and performance of the official Defndr app, these proprietary assets will not be updated here.

This repository will continue to serve as a resource for understanding the principles and architecture behind Defndr, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to privacy-preserving on-device processing. Thank you for your understanding and continued support in helping us maintain Defndr as a leading SMS spam filter.

Welcome to the Defndr GitHub repository! This repository showcases the core machine learning components that power the Defndr iOS app, an SMS spam filter designed to protect users from unwanted messages while prioritizing privacy and security.

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to provide transparency into the inner workings of Defndr. By sharing the machine learning model and vocabulary used for spam detection, we aim to demonstrate:
- **How Defndr Works**: The app uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, all processed on-device to ensure your data never leaves your phone.
- **Open Source and Secure**: We believe in being open about our technology to build trust with our users. This repository shows that Defndr is built with security and privacy in mind.
- **Educational Insight**: For users and developers interested in the technical details, this repository offers a glimpse into the ML technology behind Defndr.
